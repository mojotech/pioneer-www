        p Pioneer is composed of four pieces to keep your code as DRY as possible while maintaining layers of readability

    .components
      ul
        li
          h6 Cucumber
          p
            | Your test outlines are written in English like Gherkin that make reading and writing how the app should function simple. Gherkin is the language that Cucumber understands. It is a *Business Readable*, *Domain Specific Language* that lets you describe software’s behavior without detailing how that behavior is implemented. Gherkin serves two purposes — documentation and automated tests. The third is a bonus feature — when it yells in red it’s talking to you, telling you what code you should write.
        li
          h6 Step definitions
          p
            | Step definitions contain the assertions about the state of your webpage. These step definitions are called from the cucumber steps. The steps compose multiple widgets and widget interactions to drive the UI into a state. Then you make assertions based on the state of the DOM.
        li
          h6 Widgets
          p
            | Widgets are wrappers around your DOM. They are reusable components that abstract the specifics of interacting with your app into isolated components. That can be quickly changed in your app when the markup or interaction specifics changes.
        li
          h6 WebDriver / WebElements
          p
            | WebElements are the raw DOM elements on the page. They are what widgets wrap in a clean API for you to interact with.
