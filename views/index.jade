            for both programmers and product owners.
            It makes writing and debugging integration tests simpler,
            saving you time and frustration. Pioneer is stack agnostic,
            you can use it against your jquery powered SPA all the way up
            to a complex Ember/Angular/Backbone app.

                | Your test outlines are written in the English-like Gherkin syntax that is both simple to write and straightforward to read. Gherkin is a *Business Readable*, *Domain Specific Language* that lets you describe software’s behavior without a tight coupling to the ever evolving implementation details. Gherkin serves two primary purposes — documentation and automated tests, but offers a third bonus feature— when it yells in red it’s talking to you, telling you what code you should write.
